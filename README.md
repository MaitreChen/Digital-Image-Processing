# Digital-Image-Processing

Welcome!

In this repositories, there are two broad categories of files, as follow:

##### First

I put some of my studies and experiences in this file of **"DIP.pdf"**.

And to provoke the reader to think, I do not put the answer under every question.

Thanks for understanding!

---

##### In the second place

 I implemented something interesting manually, such as GRAY-Histogram. And in the next learning process, I will also continue to implement some source code and document it in this repository.

---

So, if there is something not in place, please contact me~~

Thanks for reading!
